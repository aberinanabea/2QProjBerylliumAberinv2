		<p>Ways on how you can plan your day:</p>
		
		<ol>
		
			<li> Set a goal. You should know what you want in order to attain something. You may be confused at first but it's alright. The important part is that you can get back on track and work on yourself. Without goals, you are ging to have no direction, no ambition to be successful, no drive to stay in school, and trouble finding a career that will provide for you.</li>
			<p></p>
			<li> Create a study plan. For a study plan, it will depend on you capability. Others can work at morning while some can't. So, they resort on studying late at night. If you think that your mind works at its fullest at night, you may study at that hour and have your sleep in the morning. Although this kind of routine can make you sick sometimes.</li>
